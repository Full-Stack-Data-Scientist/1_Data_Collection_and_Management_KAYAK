#  __Project__ ðŸš§

The marketing team needs help on a new project. After doing some user research, the team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.

In addition, user research shows that people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand which produced the content.

Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:
* Weather
* Hotels in the area

The application should then be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time.

# __Goals__ ðŸŽ¯

* Scrape data from destinations
* Get weather data from each destination
* Get hotels' info about each destination
* Store all the information above in a data lake
* Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse

# __Deliverables__ ðŸ—ƒ

 * Three .csv files in an S3 bucket containing enriched information about the weather, hotels for each french city and another one with there lat and lon coordinates.
 * Two .py files for scraping the information on booking, one for the general information, and the second for the hotels coordinates.
 * A SQL Database where with the same cleaned data from S3 you can check the screenshots for
